# R_CSV_DATA_ANALYZE
STAA57 PROJECT

**Mainly around the part-time job people in recent year**

As a group(or individual), find a dataset(or multiple datasets) from https://data.ontario.ca/ and using the dataset(s) demonstrate the use of the tools that you have learned in this course. Your report/work must include

  - Description of the variables and the data
  - A little background about the data (who collected it in what context)
  - What is the over all research question that you are trying to answer in your report
  - Few tables (appropriately labeled)
  - Few graphs (appropriately labeled)
  - Use of confidence interval and test of hypothesis
  - Use of bootstrapping
  - Use of regression analysis (linear or nonlinear regression [week-9] or logistic regression[week-10] or decision tree/random forest [Week-11]). Interpretation of the regression parameters when applicable.
  - Use of cross validation
  - A final summary of your findings
  - An appendix which shows all your codes
  - 
  3 marks will be kept aside for the presentation of your report (e.g. proper title, subtitle, graph size, graph placing, line spacing, proper annotation of your code etc.)
We are expecting a 6-10 pages report with a max of 15 pages (including everything).

  Only one person from the group needs to submit the report on behalf of a group. Please watch this video that shows how to form a group before submission: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2LtHmdu09c
